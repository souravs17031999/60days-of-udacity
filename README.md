## DAY 2 [28/6/19] Completed :

* ✅ Project -IV :🔗 https://github.com/…/noise_and_without_noise_db_analysis.ip…
* ➡️ I learnt to implement local differential privacy in the database by adding noise to the input data and how it affects the statistics.
* ✅ Project - V :🔗 https://github.com/…/random_noise_analysis_differential_pri…
* ➡️ I learnt how to add random noise by adding bias to the coin toss algorithm and how it affects the statistics and observe the changes while i grow the size of dataset.

I learnt that the idea of differential privacy is to simply block or filter out the results which are unique for a individual in a sensitive dataset and allow and focus more onto learn about the general characteristics of the individuals which is visible across most of the datapoints in the dataset.

Moving onto Project for global differential privacy.
Today i would like to encourage @elie.wanko@manishajhunjhunwala7@shashi.gharti@swapnil6195@workwithpurpose@aniketmitra1997 to follow along this path.

## DAY 5 [1/7/19] Completed :
* ✅ Project -VII :🔗 https://github.com/souravs17031999/private-ai/blob/master/annotating_unlabelled_dataset_using_dp_query.ipynb
* ➡️ Today , i learnt what was the purpose of all the previous lessons as all the topics  like creating private databases , calculating sensitivity for queries and adding noise were totally relatable to the deep learning context. 
I learnt that if we have unlabelled dataset then to annotate them with labels we can simply follow few steps - firstly we need to find similar organisations having same kind of datasets and they all have same kind of labels and then they train their models on their private datasets and give predictions , then i use that all that predictions to  find the most highest prediction and then using DP query , i label them finally.
* ✅ participated in #reading_paper_discuss quiz on Cynthia Dwork's Book chapter 1 and chaper 2 reading material and scored 70% .
